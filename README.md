*Exploring the science of stress in *Mus musculus* with data-driven bioinformatics*  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Welcome to the **Bioinformatic Baddies** repository!  

Our goal is to analyze a curated dataset related to **stress in *Mus musculus* (the common house mouse)** and answer a specific research question using modern bioinformatics techniques.  

Chronic stress is known to influence both **physical health** and **molecular pathways**. In mice, stress can lead to changes in **hair/coat condition** and **cortisol (stress hormone) regulation**, which are important markers of overall well-being. By studying these connections, we hope to uncover insights into how stress affects the body and brain. 


## ❓ Research Question  
Our guiding question is:  

***"What are the differences in gene expression related to hair loss and cortisol levels in mice exposed to stress and those not exposed to stress?***  

## 🔍 Dataset  
We are analyzing the following dataset: 👉 [Dataset Link](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/SRP181622/rem-sleeps-unique-associations-with-corticosterone-regulation-apoptotic-pathways-and-behavior-in-chronic-stress-in-mice?ref=search)  

The dataset looks at how **chronic mild stress changes sleep in mice**. It shows that **REM sleep is especially sensitive to stress**, linking it to shifts in stress hormones, immune responses, and behavior.
