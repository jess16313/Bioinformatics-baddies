*Exploring the science of sleep in *Mus musculus* with data-driven bioinformatics*  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Welcome to the **Bioinformatic Baddies** repository!  
Our goal is to analyze a curated dataset related to **sleep in *Mus musculus* (the common house mouse)** and answer a specific research question using modern bioinformatics techniques.  

Sleep is a complex biological process with important genetic and molecular underpinnings. By working with real-world data, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that shed light on sleep regulation, variability, and biological mechanisms in mice — a widely used model organism in biomedical research.  

## 🔍 Dataset  
We are analyzing the following dataset:

The dataset explores how **chronic mild stress affects sleep and behavior in mice**. Over the course of 9 weeks, researchers measured sleep patterns, stress hormones, physical health markers, and behavior, while also analyzing brain and blood samples. The findings highlight that **REM sleep** (the dream stage of sleep) is especially sensitive to stress, linking it to changes in stress regulation, immune responses, and mood-related behaviors.
